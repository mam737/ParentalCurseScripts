# ParentalCurseScripts

The following repository contains scripts used to confirm analytical results of the models detailed in Ã…gren, Munasinghe, and Clark (in review). As detailed in the paper, "we modeled selection using forward simulations that incorporated selection as a deterministic process with initial zygote frequencies, followed by selection which acts as weights on the frequencies of the zygotes, and then random mating and gamete formation following Mendelian rules." For additional details on the specifications of each model please refer to the paper. 

There are 2 scripts per model: one that tracks the time to fixation of the mutant alleles for a given paramter set (named modelX_fixtime.R) and one that tracks the change in allele frequency over time (named modelX_freqtrack.R)
